The Python script located at `/app/scripts/code_guard.py` is designed to scan a codebase for potential issues and report them back to the user. The script specifically targets Python files, excluding those in the `env` directory. Below is a detailed description of the flow and functionality of the code:

### Main Functionality

1. **Importing Modules**:
   - The script imports several modules, including `os` for interacting with the operating system, `datetime` for handling date and time, and custom modules like `PipelineUtils`, `FileUtils`, and `logger` for various utility functions and logging.

2. **Main Function**:
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of the script. It orchestrates the entire scanning process.

3. **Argument Parsing**:
   - The script uses `PipelineUtils.get_args()` to parse command-line arguments. This helps in determining the type of files to scan and the path to scan them in.

4. **File Collection**:
   - Depending on whether a path is provided via arguments, the script either uses `FileUtils.get_files_from_path(args.path, ".py")` to get Python files from a specified path or `FileUtils.get_files()` to get all Python files in the current directory.

5. **Output File Creation**:
   - An output file is created with a timestamp in its name, stored in the `./history/` directory. This file will store the analysis results.

6. **File Analysis Loop**:
   - The script iterates over each collected file:
     - **Absolute Path**: It converts the file path to an absolute path.
     - **Chatbot Creation**: A chatbot instance is created using `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)`.
     - **Logging**: The script logs the start of the analysis for each file.
     - **Analysis**: The chatbot is invoked to analyze the code for potential issues and security vulnerabilities, suggest improvements, and score the code on a scale of 1 to 10.
     - **Appending Results**: The results of each analysis step are appended to the output file.
     - **Cleanup**: The chatbot's collection and chat history are cleared after each file analysis.

### Execution

- The script is executed by running the `main()` function. This is facilitated by the following block at the end of the script:
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
  This ensures that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed directly.

### Summary

- **Initialization**: Import necessary modules and define the main function.
- **Argument Parsing**: Use `PipelineUtils.get_args()` to parse command-line arguments.
- **File Collection**: Collect Python files to be analyzed.
- **Output File**: Create an output file with a timestamp.
- **Analysis Loop**: For each file, perform the following:
  - Convert to absolute path.
  - Create a chatbot instance.
  - Log the start of analysis.
  - Invoke the chatbot to analyze the code, suggest improvements, and score the code.
  - Append results to the output file.
  - Clear the chatbot's collection and history.
- **Execution**: The script is executed by calling the `main()` function when the script is run directly.

This detailed flow provides a comprehensive understanding of the script's functionality and execution process.

## /app/scripts/code_chart.py

The Python file `/app/scripts/code_chart.py` is designed to scan a codebase for potential issues and report them back to the user. The script specifically targets Python files, excluding the `env` directory. Below is a detailed description of the code's functionality and flow:

1. **Imports and Logging Configuration**:
   - The script imports necessary modules such as `os`, `logging`, and `datetime`.
   - It also imports utility classes `PipelineUtils` and `FileUtils` from a module named `pipeline`.
   - Logging is configured to display information-level messages with timestamps.

   - The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the script.
   - It retrieves command-line arguments using `PipelineUtils.get_args()`.
   - The script sets the argument type to "py" to focus on Python files.

3. **File Retrieval**:
   - If a specific path is provided via command-line arguments, the script uses `FileUtils.get_files_from_path(args.path, ".py")` to get all Python files from that path.
   - If no path is provided, it defaults to retrieving all Python files using `FileUtils.get_files()`.

4. **Output File Creation**:
   - An output file is created with a timestamp in its name, stored in the `./history/` directory. This file will have a `.md` extension.

5. **File Analysis Loop**:
   - The script iterates over each Python file retrieved.
   - For each file, it gets the absolute path and updates `args.path`.
   - A chatbot instance is created using `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)`.

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - The script logs the file being analyzed and appends this information to the output file.
   - It invokes the chatbot to analyze the code and write a description of what the code does. The response is appended to the output file.
   - It then invokes the chatbot again to write a description that could be used for creating a detailed flow chart. This response is also appended to the output file.

7. **Cleanup**:
   - After analyzing each file, the script deletes the chatbot's collection and clears its chat history.

8. **Script Execution**:
   - The script is executed by calling the `main()` function within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

     - `prompt` (str): The information or instructions to be used to modify the script.
   - **Functionality**:
     - The function starts by reading and printing the content of the script file located at the specified `path`.
     - It then defines a system template that instructs a language model (LLM) to modify the script based on the provided information. The template ensures that the returned file is in Python and well-formatted.
     - The function retrieves arguments using `PipelineUtils.get_args()` and sets the type to 'py' and the path to the provided `path`.
     - A chatbot instance is created using `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)`.
     - The chatbot is set up with the defined system template and an output type of 'python'.
     - The chatbot is then invoked with the provided `prompt` to generate the modified script.
     - The modified script is logged using the chatbot's logger.
     - The function returns the modified script.

3. **Function: `main`**:
   - **Functionality**:
     - This is the main function of the script.
     - It defines the path to a test script located at `./tests/data/test.py`.
     - It calls the `create_script` function with the path to the test script and a prompt to write a test case for each method in the test script.

4. **Script Execution**:
   - The script includes a standard Python entry point check (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
   - If the script is executed directly, the `main` function is called, which in turn calls the `create_script` function with the specified path and prompt.

### Flow of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - The script starts by importing necessary utilities from the `pipeline` module.

2. **Reading and Printing Script Content**:
   - The `create_script` function reads the content of the script file specified by the `path` parameter and prints it.

3. **Setting Up the Language Model**:
   - A system template is defined to instruct the language model on how to modify the script.
   - Arguments are retrieved and set up for the chatbot.
   - A chatbot instance is created and configured with the system template and output type.

   - The chatbot is invoked with the provided `prompt` to generate the modified script.
   - The modified script is logged and returned by the `create_script` function.

5. **Main Function Execution**:
   - If the script is run directly, the `main` function is executed.
   - The `main` function calls the `create_script` function with a specific path and prompt to modify the test script.

This detailed description outlines the purpose and flow of the code in the `/app/scripts/create_script.py` file, providing a clear understanding of how the script operates and how it is executed.

## /app/scripts/run.py

The Python file `./run.py` authored by Babak Bandpey is designed to facilitate interactions with a chatbot. Below is a detailed description of the code's functionality and flow:

1. **Imports and Dependencies**:
   - The script imports the `datetime` module to handle date and time operations.
   - It also imports `PipelineUtils` from the `pipeline` module, which contains utility functions and classes necessary for the chatbot's operation.

2. **Main Function**:
   - The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the script. It is responsible for initializing and running the chatbot interaction loop.
   - The function starts by printing a welcome message and the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.

3. **Argument Parsing and Chatbot Initialization**:
   - The script retrieves command-line arguments by calling `PipelineUtils.get_args()`. This function likely parses and returns any necessary arguments for configuring the chatbot.
   - A chatbot instance is created using `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)`, where `args` are the parsed command-line arguments. This function initializes the chatbot with the provided configuration.

4. **Interaction Loop**:
   - The script enters an infinite loop to continuously handle user input and chatbot responses.
   - Within the loop, it prompts the user for input using `input("\n** Enter your message: ")`. If there is a previous prompt (`next_prompt`), it uses that instead.
   - The user input or the next prompt is then processed by `PipelineUtils.handle_command()`, which handles the command and returns the next prompt or response from the chatbot.
   - The loop continues until interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C).

5. **Graceful Exit**:
   - The script includes a try-except block to catch `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions, allowing for a graceful exit when the user interrupts the script.
   - Upon catching the exception, it prints a goodbye message and exits the loop.

6. **Script Execution**:
   - The script includes a conditional statement `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the `main()` function is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.

In summary, the `./run.py` script initializes a chatbot, handles user interactions in a loop, and gracefully exits upon user interruption. The key functions and classes used in the code are `PipelineUtils.get_args()`, `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot()`, and `PipelineUtils.handle_command()`. The script is executed by running the `main()` function when the script is invoked directly.

## /app/scripts/push.py

The Python script located at `/app/scripts/push.py` is designed to automate the process of committing changes to a Git repository. Below is a detailed description of the flow of the code, including the functions and classes used:

### Detailed Flow of the Code

1. **Initial Check for Changes**:
   - The script begins by checking if there are any changes to commit using the `has_changes_to_commit()` function. If no changes are detected, it logs this information and pushes any existing changes to the remote repository using the `run_command(["git", "push"])` function. The script then exits.

2. **Get Current Branch Name**:
   - The script retrieves the current branch name using the `get_current_branch_name()` function and logs this information.

3. **Handle Main Branch**:
   - If the current branch is the main branch, the script logs this information and creates a new branch using the `create_and_checkout_new_branch()` function.

4. **Stage Changes**:
   - All changes, including untracked files, are staged using the `stage_changes()` function.

5. **Generate Diff File**:
   - A `diff.txt` file is generated to include all changes using the `generate_diff()` function.

6. **Run Tests**:
   - The script runs tests using the `run_tests()` function. If the tests fail, the script logs the failure and exits.

7. **Create Chatbot for Pre-Commit Checks**:
   - The script creates a chatbot to perform various checks before committing the changes. This is done using the `PipelineUtils.get_args()` and `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)` functions.

8. **Run Pre-Commit Checks**:
   - The script runs several checks using the chatbot, including security checks, vulnerability checks, code quality checks, and pylint checks. This is handled by the `run_checks(chatbot)` function. If any of these checks fail, the script logs the failure, unstages the changes using the `unstage_changes()` function, performs cleanup using the `cleanup()` function, and exits.

9. **Generate Commit Message**:
   - The script generates a commit message using the chatbot. This is done in the `create_commit_message(chatbot)` function. The user is prompted to confirm the commit message. If the user is not satisfied, the script allows for re-generation of the commit message.

10. **User Confirmation**:
    - The script prompts the user to confirm whether they want to continue with the commit. If the user chooses not to proceed, the script logs this information and exits.

11. **Perform Git Commit**:
    - If the user confirms, the script performs the git commit using the `run_command(["git", "commit", "-aF", "commit_message.txt"])` function.

12. **Cleanup**:
    - The script performs cleanup by removing temporary files using the `cleanup()` function.

13. **Set Upstream Branch and Push Changes**:
    - Finally, the script sets the upstream branch and pushes the changes to the remote repository using the `run_command(["git", "push", "--set-upstream", "origin", branch_name])` function.

### Execution of the Script

The script is executed through the `main()` function, which encapsulates the entire flow described above. The `main()` function is called at the end of the script using the following conditional:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This ensures that the script runs only when it is executed directly, and not when it is imported as a module in another script.

## /app/scripts/codify.py

The Python script located at `/app/scripts/codify.py` is designed to function as an AI agent that processes text content to codify it into policies and standards. Below is a detailed description of the flow and functionality of the code:

### Main Function
The script begins execution in the `main()` function, which serves as the entry point. This function orchestrates the overall flow of the script.

1. **Argument Parsing**:
   - The script uses `PipelineUtils.get_args()` to parse command-line arguments. These arguments are essential for configuring the chatbot and other utilities.

2. **Chatbot Creation**:
   - The `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)` function is called to create an instance of the chatbot using the parsed arguments. This chatbot will be used to interact with the content and generate responses.

3. **Initial Chatbot Invocation**:
   - The chatbot is invoked with a specific prompt: "Which subjects are covered in the content? Format the answer as a python Dictionary and do not add any extra information to it." This prompt is designed to get a structured response from the chatbot, listing the subjects covered in the content.

4. **Processing the Answer**:
   - The `process_answer(answer, chatbot)` function is called to handle the response from the chatbot. This function is responsible for parsing the chatbot's response and further interacting with the chatbot to extract detailed requirements for each subject.

### `process_answer` Function
This function processes the initial answer received from the chatbot and performs the following steps:

1. **Answer Parsing**:
   - The function attempts to clean and parse the chatbot's response into a JSON object. If the response is not a valid JSON, an error message is printed.

2. **Iterating Over Subjects**:
   - The function iterates over the keys (subjects) in the parsed JSON object. For each subject, it further interacts with the chatbot to find all the requirements related to that subject.

3. **Detailed Requirements Extraction**:
   - For each subject, the chatbot is invoked with a prompt to find all the requirements and format them as an ordered bullet list. The response is then printed.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - After printing the requirements for each subject, the user is prompted to decide whether to continue or stop. If the user chooses to stop, the iteration breaks.

### Continuous Interaction Loop
After processing the initial answer, the script enters a continuous loop where it waits for user input:

1. **Handling User Commands**:
   - The `PipelineUtils.handle_command()` function is called with the user's input and the chatbot instance. This function processes the user's commands and interacts with the chatbot accordingly.

2. **Graceful Exit**:
   - The loop continues until interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C), at which point a goodbye message is logged, and the script exits gracefully.

### Execution
The script is executed by running the `main()` function, which is guarded by the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This ensures that the script runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.

### Summary
In summary, the `/app/scripts/codify.py` script is a chatbot-based AI agent that processes text content to extract and codify policies and standards. It involves argument parsing, chatbot creation, initial and continuous interaction with the chatbot, and user-driven control flow. The main function orchestrates these steps, ensuring a structured and interactive execution of the script.

If not, it logs an error and raises a `ValueError`. It then calls the `organize_content(args)` function to process the files. If interrupted by a keyboard interrupt, it logs an exit message.

### Organize Content
- **`organize_content(args)`**: This is the main function responsible for organizing the content of the files. It performs the following steps:
  1. **Retrieve Files**: Uses `FileUtils.get_files(args.path, f".{args.type}")` to get a list of files with the specified type in the given path.
  2. **Process Each File**: For each file, it creates an output file with a timestamp and initializes a chatbot using `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)`.
  3. **Analyze Content**: It sends a prompt to the chatbot to analyze the content and list the areas covered. The results are written to the output file.
  4. **List Requirements**: For each area covered, it sends another prompt to list the relevant requirements needed to comply with that area. The results are formatted and appended to the output file.

### Analyzer Function
- **`analyzer(chatbot, prompt)`**: This function interacts with the chatbot to analyze the content based on the provided prompt. It logs the prompt, sends it to the chatbot, and expects a JSON-formatted response. The response is parsed using `ChatbotUtils.parse_json(response)` and returned.

### Utility Functions and Classes
- **`PipelineUtils`**: Contains utility functions for argument parsing and chatbot creation.
- **`FileUtils`**: Provides functions for file operations such as retrieving files, writing to files, and prepending content to files.
- **`ChatbotUtils`**: Includes functions for logging, parsing JSON responses, and processing JSON responses.

The script primarily consists of three main functions: `main()`, `analyze_files_in_path()`, and `generate_readme_from_analysis()`. Here's a detailed description of what each part of the code does:

1. **main() Function**:
   - This is the entry point of the script. It defines a list of paths that need to be analyzed for generating `README.md` files.
   - It retrieves command-line arguments using `PipelineUtils.get_args()` and sets specific parameters like the model type (`gpt-4o`) and file type (`py`).
   - The function then iterates over each path in the list, calling `analyze_files_in_path()` to analyze the files and `generate_readme_from_analysis()` to generate the `README.md` files based on the analysis.

2. **analyze_files_in_path(path, args) Function**:
   - This function takes a directory path and arguments as input and analyzes the Python files within that directory.
   - It initializes an empty list called `analysis` to store the analysis results.
   - The function uses `os.walk()` to iterate over the files in the specified directory, filtering out hidden files and subdirectories.
   - For each Python file, it creates a chatbot instance using `PipelineUtils.create_chatbot(args)` and invokes it to generate a detailed description of the file's content, focusing on the functions and classes used.
   - The analysis results, including the file path and description, are appended to the `analysis` list.
   - The chatbot's collection is deleted, and its chat history is cleared after each file is processed.

3. **generate_readme_from_analysis(path, analysis, args) Function**:
   - This function takes a directory path, analysis results, and arguments as input and generates a `README.md` file based on the analysis.
   - It creates or overwrites the `README.md` file in the specified directory.
   - The function iterates over the analysis results and appends the file descriptions to the `README.md` file.
   - It also saves the analysis results to a JSON file in the `/app/history` directory.
   - A chatbot instance is created to generate an introduction and summary for the `README.md` file based on the analysis JSON file.
   - The chatbot's collection is deleted, and its chat history is cleared after generating the summary.
