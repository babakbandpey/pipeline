# README.md

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts located in the `/app/scripts` directory. These scripts are designed to perform various tasks such as code analysis, script modification, and content organization. This README provides a detailed description of each script, usage instructions, and information on contributing, licensing, authors, and acknowledgements.

## Detailed Description of Each Script

### 1. `code_chart.py`
The `code_chart.py` script is designed to scan a codebase for potential issues and report them back to the user. It specifically targets Python files, excluding the `env` directory. The script automates the process of scanning Python files for issues, suggesting improvements, and scoring the code. It leverages a chatbot for the analysis and logs the results in a timestamped markdown file.

### 2. `code_guard.py`
The `code_guard.py` script is similar to `code_chart.py` and is designed to scan a codebase for potential issues and report them back to the user. It also targets Python files, excluding the `env` directory. The script automates the process of scanning Python files for issues, suggesting improvements, and scoring the code. It leverages a chatbot for the analysis and logs the results in a timestamped markdown file.

### 3. `organizer.py`
The `organizer.py` script is designed to read the content of files, analyze it, and organize it in a structured manner. It initializes and configures a chatbot, interacts with the chatbot to extract and process information from the content, and continuously engages with the user to refine and display the extracted information. The script handles errors and interruptions gracefully.

### 4. `create_script.py`
The `create_script.py` script is designed to modify the content of an existing script file based on a given prompt. It reads the content of the script, defines a system template for the language model to modify the script, and uses a chatbot to generate the modified script. The modified script is then logged and returned.
