The Python file `/app/pipeline/chatbot.py` is designed to implement a chatbot pipeline. Here's a detailed description of the code and its flow:

### Classes and Functions

1. **Chatbot Class**:
   - **Inheritance**: The `Chatbot` class inherits from the `Pipeline` class, which is presumably defined in another module.
   - **Purpose**: This class is responsible for handling the chatbot's operations, including receiving prompts, sanitizing inputs, invoking the pipeline, and managing responses.

2. **Logging Configuration**:
   - **Logging Level**: The logging is configured to the `WARNING` level for production use, which means only warnings, errors, and critical messages will be logged.
   - **Logger Instance**: A logger instance is created using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

3. **invoke Method**:
   - **Parameters**: Takes a single parameter `prompt`, which is a string input from the user.
   - **Validation**: Checks if the `prompt` is a non-empty string. If not, it logs an error and returns an error message.
   - **Sanitization**: Calls the `sanitize_input` method to sanitize the prompt.
   - **Pipeline Invocation**: Uses the `super().invoke(sanitized_prompt)` to invoke the parent class's `invoke` method with the sanitized prompt.
   - **Response Handling**: Checks if the response object has a `content` attribute. If not, it logs an error and raises an `AttributeError`.
   - **Exception Handling**: Catches and logs any `AttributeError` or other exceptions that occur during the invocation process.

4. **sanitize_input Method**:
   - **Parameters**: Takes a single parameter `input_str`, which is the input string to be sanitized.
   - **Sanitization Logic**: Replaces potentially harmful characters like `<` and `>` with their HTML-escaped equivalents (`&lt;` and `&gt;`).
   - **Returns**: The sanitized input string.

### Execution Flow

1. **Input Validation**: When the `invoke` method is called, it first validates the input to ensure it is a non-empty string.
2. **Sanitization**: The input is then sanitized to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
3. **Pipeline Invocation**: The sanitized input is passed to the parent class's `invoke` method to get a response.
4. **Response Validation**: The response is checked to ensure it has the expected `content` attribute.
5. **Error Handling**: Any errors during the process are logged and raised appropriately.

### Main Function

The provided code snippet does not include a `main` function or any code that would execute the script directly. Therefore, it appears that this module is intended to be imported and used within a larger application rather than being run as a standalone script.

### Summary

The `/app/pipeline/chatbot.py` file defines a `Chatbot` class that extends a `Pipeline` class to handle chatbot operations. It includes methods for input validation, sanitization, pipeline invocation, and response handling, with robust logging and error management. The absence of a `main` function suggests that this module is designed to be part of a larger system rather than a standalone executable script.

## /app/pipeline/config.py

The Python file `/app/pipeline/config.py` is designed to handle the configuration and setup for a project, particularly focusing on loading and decrypting environment variables, configuring logging, and ensuring sensitive information is managed securely. Below is a detailed description of the flow and functionality of the code:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**:
   - The script begins by importing necessary libraries such as `os`, `logging`, `base64`, and `getpass` for various functionalities.
   - It also imports cryptographic modules from `cryptography.hazmat.primitives` and `cryptography.fernet` for encryption and decryption purposes.
   - The `dotenv` library is imported to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

2. **Loading Environment Variables**:
   - The `load_dotenv()` function is called to load all environment variables from a `.env` file into the script's environment. This allows the script to access these variables using `os.environ`.

3. **Configuring Logging**:
   - The logging level is set to `INFO` using the `LOGGING_LEVEL` variable.
   - The `logging.basicConfig()` function is used to configure the logging format and level.
   - A logger instance is created using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

4. **Key Derivation Function**:
   - The `derive_key(passphrase: str, salt: bytes) -> bytes` function is defined to derive a cryptographic key from a passphrase and salt using the PBKDF2HMAC algorithm. This key is used for encryption and decryption.

5. **Decryption Function**:
   - The `decrypt(encrypted_text: str, passphrase: str) -> str` function is defined to decrypt an encrypted text using a passphrase. It first decodes the encrypted text from base64, extracts the salt, derives the key using the `derive_key` function, and then decrypts the text using the `Fernet` class from the `cryptography` library. If decryption fails, it logs an error and returns `None`.

6. **Passphrase Handling and Environment Variable Decryption**:
   - The script prompts the user to enter a passphrase using `getpass("Enter passphrase to decrypt .env, or 0 if the .env is not encrypted: ")`.
   - If the user enters '0', it assumes the `.env` file is not encrypted and directly loads the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_1` from the environment.
   - If a passphrase is provided, it attempts to decrypt these environment variables using the `decrypt` function. If decryption fails, it logs appropriate error messages.

7. **Version Control Note**:
   - The script includes a comment reminding users to ensure the `.env` file is not included in version control by adding it to `.gitignore` or encrypting it using a separate script (`env_encryptor.py`).

8. **Execution Flow**:
   - The script does not contain a `main` function or any explicit entry point for execution. It is designed to be executed as a standalone script where the flow starts from the top and proceeds sequentially.

In summary, the script `/app/pipeline/config.py` is primarily focused on securely loading and decrypting environment variables, configuring logging, and ensuring sensitive information is managed properly. It uses functions like `derive_key` and `decrypt` to handle cryptographic operations and relies on user input for passphrase management.

## /app/pipeline/logger.py

The Python file `/app/pipeline/logger.py` is designed to set up a custom logging system that enhances the standard logging module by adding color-coded log messages based on their severity levels. Here is a detailed description of the flow and functionality of the code:

1. **Import Statements**:
   - The script begins by importing necessary modules: `inspect`, `os`, and `logging`.
   - It also imports `LOGGING_LEVEL` from a local `config` module, which is presumably used to set the logging level dynamically.

2. **Function: `get_importing_file_name`**:
   - This function is designed to determine the name of the file that imports this logging module.
   - It uses the `inspect.stack()` function to examine the call stack and retrieves the module of the caller's caller (i.e., the file that is two levels up in the call stack).
   - If the module is found, it returns the base name of the file using `os.path.basename(module.__file__)`. If not, it returns `None`.

3. **Class: `ColoredFormatter`**:
   - This is a custom logging formatter class that inherits from `logging.Formatter`.
   - **Attributes**:
     - `COLORS`: A dictionary mapping log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) to their corresponding ANSI color codes.
     - `RESET`: An ANSI code to reset the color back to the default.
   - **Method: `format`**:
     - This method overrides the `format` method of the base `logging.Formatter` class.
     - It first calls the superclass's `format` method to get the original log message.
     - It then applies the appropriate color based on the log level by wrapping the message with the corresponding ANSI color codes.
     - Finally, it returns the colorized log message.

4. **Handler and Formatter Setup**:
   - A `StreamHandler` is created, which directs log messages to the console.
   - An instance of `ColoredFormatter` is created with a specific format string that includes the timestamp, filename, line number, and the log message.
   - The custom formatter is set on the handler.

5. **Logger Setup**:
   - The root logger is obtained using `logging.getLogger(get_importing_file_name())`, which names the logger after the importing file.
   - The logging level is set using the `LOGGING_LEVEL` imported from the `config` module.
   - The custom handler (with the colored formatter) is added to the logger.

**Execution**:
- The script does not contain a `main` function or any code that would execute it directly. It is designed to be imported as a module, and its functionality is triggered when the importing file sets up logging using this module.

In summary, the script sets up a custom logging system with color-coded log messages to enhance readability. It dynamically names the logger based on the importing file and configures the logging level based on an external configuration. The primary components are the `get_importing_file_name` function, the `ColoredFormatter` class, and the setup of the logging handler and logger.

## /app/pipeline/txt_rag.py

The Python file `/app/pipeline/txt_rag.py` contains the implementation of the `TxtRAG` class, which is part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This class extends the `Retrieval` class and is designed to handle text documents, load them, extract metadata, split them into chunks, and store them in a vector database for efficient retrieval. Below is a detailed description of the flow of the code:

### Class: TxtRAG

#### Initialization (`__init__` method)
- **Purpose**: Initializes the `TxtRAG` object with configuration parameters.
- **Parameters**: Accepts a dictionary of configuration parameters (`kwargs`).
- **Key Actions**:
  - Sets the `path` attribute to the directory or file path containing text documents.
  - Sets the `auto_clean` attribute to determine if automatic cleaning is enabled.
  - Raises a `ValueError` if the `path` parameter is not provided.
  - Initializes an empty list `documents` to store loaded documents.
  - Calls `check_for_non_ascii_bytes()` to ensure documents do not contain non-ASCII bytes.
  - Calls `load_documents()` to load the text documents from the specified path.
  - Calls `extract_and_add_metadata()` to extract and add metadata from the documents.
  - Calls `split_and_store_documents()` to split the documents into chunks and store them in a vector database.

#### Method: `_load_documents`
- **Purpose**: Loads text documents from the filesystem.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Checks if the `path` is a directory or a single file.
  - Uses `DirectoryLoader` to load all `.txt` files from a directory.
  - Uses `TextLoader` to load a single `.txt` file.
  - Stores the loaded documents in the `documents` attribute.

#### Method: `extract_and_add_metadata`
- **Purpose**: Extracts metadata from the first line of each document if it is a JSON object and adds it to the document's metadata.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Iterates through each document in the `documents` list.
  - Checks if the first line of the document is a JSON object.
  - Parses the JSON object to extract metadata.
  - Updates the document's metadata with the extracted metadata.
  - Removes the first line (metadata) from the document's content.

#### Method: `split_and_store_documents`
- **Purpose**: Splits the documents into chunks and sets up the vector store for efficient retrieval.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the documents into chunks of a specified size.
  - Calls `split_data` to perform the actual splitting.
  - Calls `setup_vector_store` to store the chunks in a local vector database.

### Execution Flow
The script does not contain a `main` function or any code that directly executes the `TxtRAG` class. Instead, it is designed to be imported and used as part of a larger application. The typical flow of execution when using this class would be:
1. Import the `TxtRAG` class.
2. Instantiate the `TxtRAG` class with the required configuration parameters.
3. The initialization process automatically loads documents, extracts metadata, splits documents into chunks, and stores them in a vector database.

### Example Usage
```python
from pipeline.txt_rag import TxtRAG

# Configuration parameters
config = {
    'path': '/path/to/text/files',
    'auto_clean': True
}

# Instantiate the TxtRAG class
txt_rag = TxtRAG(**config)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `TxtRAG` class by providing the necessary configuration parameters and instantiating the class. The class methods handle the rest of the process automatically.

## /app/pipeline/rag_factory.py

The Python file `/app/pipeline/rag_factory.py` is designed to facilitate the creation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) objects based on a specified type. This is achieved through a factory design pattern implemented in the `RAGFactory` class. Below is a detailed description of the code and its flow:

### Overview

The primary purpose of this file is to provide a flexible and dynamic way to instantiate different types of RAG objects. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the type of RAG object needed can vary, and the exact class to be instantiated is determined at runtime.

### Key Components

1. **Imports**:
   - The `importlib` module is imported to dynamically import other modules at runtime.
   - The `Retrieval` class is imported from the `retrieval` module, which serves as a base class or interface for the RAG classes.

2. **RAG Mapping**:
   - A dictionary named `rag_mapping` is defined to map string identifiers (e.g., 'chat', 'txt', 'py') to their corresponding module and class names. This mapping is crucial for the dynamic instantiation process.

3. **RAGFactory Class**:
   - The `RAGFactory` class is a factory class responsible for creating instances of RAG objects based on a specified type.
   - **Static Method `get_rag_class`**:
     - This method is the core of the factory class. It takes a type identifier (`_type`) and additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
     - It retrieves the module and class names from the `rag_mapping` dictionary based on the provided `_type`.
     - If the type is not found in the mapping, a `ValueError` is raised.
     - The method then dynamically imports the specified module using `importlib.import_module`.
     - It retrieves the class from the imported module using `getattr`.
     - Finally, it instantiates the class with the provided keyword arguments and returns the instance.

### Execution Flow

1. **Type Identification**:
   - The user specifies the type of RAG object they need by providing a string identifier (e.g., 'txt', 'chat').

2. **Mapping Lookup**:
   - The `get_rag_class` method looks up the corresponding module and class names in the `rag_mapping` dictionary.

3. **Dynamic Import**:
   - The specified module is dynamically imported using `importlib.import_module`.

4. **Class Retrieval and Instantiation**:
   - The class is retrieved from the imported module using `getattr`.
   - The class is instantiated with any additional keyword arguments provided by the user.

5. **Return Instance**:
   - The instantiated RAG object is returned to the caller.

### Main Function

The provided code does not include a `main` function or any direct script execution logic. It is designed to be used as a module that other parts of the application can import and utilize. Therefore, the script is not executed directly but rather through calls to the `RAGFactory.get_rag_class` method from other parts of the application.

### Summary

In summary, the `/app/pipeline/rag_factory.py` file provides a flexible and dynamic way to create RAG objects based on a specified type. The `RAGFactory` class, particularly its `get_rag_class` method, is the core component that facilitates this functionality through dynamic module importing and class instantiation. The absence of a `main` function indicates that this file is intended to be used as a utility module within a larger application.

## /app/pipeline/pipeline_utils.py

The Python file `/app/pipeline/pipeline_utils.py` is designed to facilitate the configuration and execution of a chatbot pipeline. It includes utility functions and classes that handle argument parsing, chatbot creation, command handling, and other supportive tasks. Below is a detailed description of the code's functionality and flow:

### Classes and Functions

1. **PipelineUtils Class**
   - **`get_args` Method**: This method is responsible for parsing command-line arguments using the `argparse` library. It defines various arguments such as `--model`, `--type`, `--path`, `--url`, `--git_url`, `--openai_api_key`, `--example`, `--prompt`, `--system_prompt_template`, `--output_type`, and `--collection_name`. The parsed arguments are returned as a namespace object.
   
   - **`create_chatbot` Method**: This method creates and returns a chatbot instance based on the provided arguments. It uses the `RAGFactory` class to get the appropriate chatbot class for different types such as "chat", "txt", "python", "web", "pdf", and "json". If the `--example` flag is set, it prints examples of how to run the script and exits.

   - **`get_base_url_and_api_key` Method**: This method determines the base URL and API key based on the specified model. It supports models like "llama3", "phi3", "gpt", "azure", and "lmstudio". If the model is not found, it logs an error and exits.

   - **`get_kwargs` Method**: This method constructs a dictionary of keyword arguments required for creating the chatbot. It includes the base URL, API key, collection name, git URL, path, and URL.

2. **Command Handling Functions**
   - **`handle_command` Method**: This method handles various commands that can be issued to the chatbot. It includes commands like `/exit`, `/reset`, `/history`, `/delete`, `/summarize`, `/save`, and `/help`. Each command is mapped to a corresponding function that performs the required action.

   - **`save_chat_history` Function**: This function saves the chat history to a file in the "history" directory. The filename includes a timestamp to ensure uniqueness.

   - **`default_action` Function**: This function logs the chatbot's response to a given prompt.

   - **`exit_chat` Function**: This function logs a goodbye message and exits the script.

   - **`show_history` Function**: This function logs the chat history if it exists. It returns `True` if the history is shown, otherwise `False`.

   - **`delete_message` Function**: This function deletes a message from the chat history based on user input. It supports both positive and negative indices for deletion.

   - **`print_commands_help` Function**: This function prints the available commands and their descriptions.

### Script Execution

The script does not explicitly include a `main` function, but the flow of execution can be inferred from the methods and functions provided:

1. **Argument Parsing**: The script starts by calling the `get_args` method to parse command-line arguments.
2. **Chatbot Creation**: Based on the parsed arguments, the `create_chatbot` method is called to create a chatbot instance.
3. **Command Handling**: The `handle_command` method is used to process commands issued to the chatbot. This method retrieves the appropriate function from a dictionary and executes it.

### Example Usage

To run the script, you would typically use a command like:

```sh
python /app/pipeline/pipeline_utils.py --type=chat --model=gpt-4o --prompt="Hello, chatbot!"
```

This command would:
1. Parse the arguments to determine the type of chatbot and model to use.
2. Create a chatbot instance using the specified model.
3. Handle the prompt command to interact with the chatbot.

In summary, the `/app/pipeline/pipeline_utils.py` file provides a comprehensive set of utilities for configuring and running a chatbot pipeline, including argument parsing, chatbot creation, and command handling. The script is executed by parsing command-line arguments and invoking the appropriate methods and functions based on those arguments.

## /app/pipeline/retrieval.py

#### Methods in `Retrieval` Class:

1. **`setup_chat_prompt(self, system_template=None, output_type=None)`**:
   - This method sets up the prompt for the chatbot. It takes an optional `system_template` parameter, which is a string template for the system's response. If no template is provided, a default template is used.
   - The method ensures that the `system_template` contains a placeholder for the context and raises a `ValueError` if the template is not a string.

2. **`setup_chain(self, search_type=None, search_kwargs=None)`**:
   - This method sets up the chatbot pipeline chain, which includes a series of processing steps.
   - It validates the `search_type` parameter, which determines the type of search to use (e.g., "mmr", "similarity", "similarity_score_threshold").
   - It also validates the `search_kwargs` parameter, which is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the search.
   - The method creates a prompt using `ChatPromptTemplate` and sets up a retriever using `self.vector_store.as_retriever`.
   - It then creates a retrieval chain by combining a history-aware retriever and a document combination chain.

3. **`load_documents(self)`**:
   - This method loads Python documents from the filesystem. It calls a private method `_load_documents` and handles various exceptions such as `UnicodeDecodeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `PermissionError`.

4. **`_load_documents(self)`**:
   - This is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It is responsible for initializing the `documents` attribute by loading documents from the filesystem.

5. **`invoke(self, prompt) -> str`**:
   - This method invokes the chatbot with a specified query. It sanitizes the input prompt, adds it to the chat history, and calls the `super().invoke` method to get a response.
   - The response is then added to the chat history, and the answer is returned.

6. **`check_for_non_ascii_bytes(self)`**:
   - This method checks for non-ASCII bytes in a text file or directory. If non-ASCII bytes are found, it either cleans the file automatically or raises a `ValueError` prompting the user to clean the file manually.
   - It uses a helper function `detect_and_clean` to perform the check and cleaning.

### Execution Flow:
The script does not contain a `main` function or any code that directly executes the script. Instead, it defines a class that is likely intended to be used as part of a larger application. The methods in the `Retrieval` class are designed to be called by other parts of the application to set up the chatbot pipeline, load documents, invoke the chatbot, and check for non-ASCII bytes.

### Summary:
- The `Retrieval` class sets up a chatbot pipeline for document retrieval and question answering.
- It includes methods for setting up the chat prompt, creating the processing chain, loading documents, invoking the chatbot, and checking for non-ASCII bytes.
- The script is designed to be used as part of a larger application and does not contain a `main` function for direct execution.
