Explanation:

scan_ip(ip_address):

Uses subprocess.Popen to execute the nmap command with the specified IP address and flags (-p- for all ports, -sV for version detection).
Captures the output and error streams from the nmap process.
Decodes the output from bytes to a string.
search_vulnerabilities(nmap_output):

This function is a placeholder. You'll need to implement the logic to:
Parse the nmap_output to extract relevant information like open ports, services, and versions.
Construct queries for vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD, Exploit-DB) using the extracted information.
Make API calls to the vulnerability databases and process the responses.
Main Execution (if __name__ == "__main__":)

Sets the ip_address to scan.
Calls scan_ip to get the nmap output.
Calls search_vulnerabilities to search for vulnerabilities based on the nmap output.
Prints the found vulnerabilities or a message if none are found.
Important Considerations:

Vulnerability Database APIs: You'll need to find and use the appropriate APIs for the vulnerability databases you want to query. Each database may have its own API documentation and authentication requirements.
Parsing Nmap Output: Parsing the nmap output to extract relevant information can be complex. You might need to use regular expressions or other text processing techniques.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to handle cases where the nmap command fails, the API calls are unsuccessful, or the output is malformed.
